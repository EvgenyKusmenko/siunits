/* Beta-version: This is intended to become a MontiCore stable grammar. */

/**
 * This grammar declares SI unit also as types 
 * based on all the available SI unit definitions
 *
 * The definitions are fully compliant to the definitions given in
 *   International Bureau of Weights and Measures (20 May 2019),
 *   SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI)
 *   (9th ed.)
 *
 * With this definition an SI Unit such as "kg/m" 
 * can also be used as type definition.
 * Note that this form does not preclude a numeric type, such as "int" 
 * or "float". Instead it assumes an (idealistic) mathematical 
 * form of type definition for math. variables.
 *
 * An extension of the typecheck algorithms is available.
 * The typecheck ensures correct typing of mathematical expressions.
